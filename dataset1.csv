Converting conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to electric counterparts has become an essential endeavor in the pursuit of ecologically sustainable mobility alternatives. The feasibility and execution tactics of converting current TVS Streak Scooters into electric scooters are the main topics of this study. To determine what has to be changed for an electric conversion, a thorough evaluation of the TVS Streak Scooter’s mechanical and electrical properties is first carried out. To ensure compatibility with electric propulsion systems, this entails assessing crucial parts, including the chassis, suspension, and braking system. Then, taking performance, range, and efficiency into consideration, the proper electric components—such as motors, batteries, controllers, and charging systems—are carefully chosen and integrated. The study also covers the certification requirements, safety standards, and regulatory compliance related to retrofitti"," The feasibility and execution tactics of converting current TVS Streak Scooters into electric scooters are the main topics of this study .
